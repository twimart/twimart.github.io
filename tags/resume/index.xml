I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying computer science (in a BTS SIO), and I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in computer network administration, as well as in cybersecurity. This site serves as a portfolio, but also as personal notes that I use for the missions I have to accomplish for my studies.
The BTS SIO During these two years of BTS, I learned the basic principles of computer networks, the different communication protocols, network architectures and network security.</description></item></channel></rss>
