To do this, we must create a VLAN dedicated to the switch configuration (here vlan 10). The IP we are going to define will be associated to this VLAN.

We will first hide the future passwords that we will put on this switch, so that they will not be displayed on the screen even during a show running config. So we will add the password-encryption service.\nSwitch(config)# service password-encryption Then we can define the password that will be requested when we need to access to the privileged mode:\nSwitchToto(config)# enable secret P@55w0rd Now, if I want to access to the privileged mode, I will have to enter the \u0026ldquo;P@55w0rd\u0026rdquo; password (which is a very bad password btw).\nSave the configuration Explanation The Cisco switch has 2 configurations: the \u0026ldquo;running-config\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;startup-config\u0026rdquo;. When the switch starts, it uses its \u0026ldquo;startup-config\u0026rdquo;. If configuration changes are created, they will be done in the running-config. The switch will then use its \u0026ldquo;running-config\u0026rdquo;. On the other hand, if the changes made turn out to be a failure, it is enough to reboot it. Thus, the switch will use its \u0026ldquo;startup-config\u0026rdquo;, which has not changed. When changes made are validated, the running-config can be copied to the startup-config. The changes will then be taken into account in the default startup-config of the switch.\nCommands SwitchToto# copy running-config st Destination filename [startup-config]? Building configuration...
