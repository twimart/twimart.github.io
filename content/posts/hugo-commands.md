### - hugo new site sitename -f yml ###

Allows you to create the basic files for the creation of a new web site. The "-f yml" option will force the creation of the main configuration file in .yml (which I recommend).

Allows you to launch the web server from Hugo; this will allows us to see in live the modifications made to our web site. You have to execute this commands in the root from our site.
