### About me ###

My name is Thomas, and I live in Amiens, France. I'm currently a computer science student, and I'm very interested in computer network administration, as well as in cybersecurity.
This site serves me as a portfolio, but also as personal notes for the missions I have to accomplish for my studies.

### My projects ###

The design and maintenance of this site is already a project in itself: indeed the web development is not really my strong point and it took a lot of time to make this website working... But I have learn several things ðŸ™‚.

### My Certifications ###

I have a Cisco Netacad NDG Linux Essential certification. This certification attests to my knowledge of basic Linux commands.
