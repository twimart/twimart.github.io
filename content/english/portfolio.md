### About me ###

My name is Thomas, and I live in Amiens, France. I'm currently studying computer science (in a BTS SIO), and I'm very interested in computer network administration, as well as in cybersecurity.
This site serves as a portfolio, but also as personal notes that I use for the missions I have to accomplish for my studies.

### The BTS SIO ###

During these two years of BTS, I learned the basic principles of computer networks, the different communication protocols, network architectures and network security. This BTS allowed me to have basic but concrete knowledge, and will be a springboard for my student career.

### My projects ###

The design and maintenance of this site is already a project in itself: indeed the web development is not really my strong point and it took a lot of time to make this website working... But I have learn several things ðŸ™‚.

### My Certifications ###

I have a Cisco Netacad NDG Linux Essential certification. This certification attests to my knowledge of basic Linux commands.
