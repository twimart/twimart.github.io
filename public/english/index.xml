      <description>About me My name is Thomas, and I live in Amiens, France. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a computer science student, and I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in computer network administration, as well as in cybersecurity. This site serves me as a portfolio, but also as personal notes for the missions I have to accomplish for my studies.
